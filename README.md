### Introduction
Hi, I am Junior at Northeastern University, pursuing a dual major in Computer Sciece and Design. I am passionate about user experience, user interaction, and data analysis. 

While I primarily learn CS and Desgin, I am also interested in researching human behaviour from social and cultural perspectives, enriched by my experiences living in South Korea, New Zealand, and now the United States. 

I value a driven, empathetic, and growth-oriented mindset, and I aim to contribute to creating innovative and healthy platforms in the future!

### Projects

#### [Prediction of Stroke Risk through Machine Learning](https://github.com/joomee320/HeartStroke)
*Python*

Strokes are a pervasive and oftentimes fatal condition that affects millions of people around the world. Predicting strokes based on various biomarkers and risk factors gives significant insights for prevention and early intervention. This study aims to develop machine learning models to accurately predict strokes with a dataset containing 15 features and more than 4,000 entries. We performed exploratory data analysis and implemented three machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classification. These models were trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30% data, with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The best model had an accuracy of about 0.86 on the test set. Analyzing the features revealed that age, blood pressure, glucose, BMI, and cholesterol were the most significant predictors for strokes. These findings align well with the current medical knowledge and can potentially guide healthcare professionals. However, the models suffered in precision and recall, indicating that they must be improved before any potential use in the industry.


#### [Predictive Models for Diagnosing PCOS](https://github.com/joomee320/PCOS)
*Python*

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age worldwide. 
In spite of PCOS being the most common endocrinopathy affecting 8% to 13% of reproductive aged women, the primary challenge in managing PCOS lies in its diagnosis and identifying the risk factors due to its heterogeneous nature and the overlap of its symptoms with other health conditions mentioned above. 
Therefore, for our project, our primary objective is to develop concrete predictive models that can help researchers and healthcare professionals to diagnose PCOS and predict its risk factors. 



#### [Maze Game](link-to-github-repository)
*Java*

Maze Game is a Java-developed game that incorporates Kruskal's algorithm to generate a unique maze layout for each session, ensurng a non-reptitive and engaging experience. MazeGame intgrates both breath-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms, offering efficient solutions for maze traversal and demonstrating advanced problem-solving techniques through graphical representation. Users are allowed to press 'b' for BFS traversal and 'd' for DFS traversal if they find the maze challenging.

#### Reversi 
*Java*

Reversi is a Java-based desktop strategy board game featuring a hexagonal grid for two players with black and white game pieces. The game includes a sophisticated AI opponent and a user-friendly interface for human players. The AI employs a robust strategy pattern algorithm that adapts to and challenges the human player's tactics throughout gameplay. Utilizing Java Swing, Reversi offers a visually engaging game board with interactive black and white pieces, ensuring an immersive and dynamic gaming experience.
